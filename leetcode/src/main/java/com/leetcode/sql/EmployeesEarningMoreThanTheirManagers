A.
SELECT y.Name FROM(
SELECT  a.Id as Id ,a.Name as Name,a.Salary as Salary,a.ManagerId as ManagerId 
From employee a 
)y
where y.Salary > (SELECT b.Salary FROM employee b WHERE b.Id=y.ManagerId)

B.
SELECT  a.Name as Name
From Employee a ,Employee b 
where a.ManagerId=b.Id and a.Salary>b.Salary

C.
SELECT  a.Name as Name
From Employee a inner join Employee b 
where a.ManagerId=b.Id and a.Salary>b.Salary
